# :bell: Doorbell Plus | AI-Based Doorbell Notifier

This project implements an AI-based system to identify doorbell sounds through real time audio recording and notify the user via a notification. This system consists of a recording component using `pvRecorder`, Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning model for classification using `sk-learn`, and a graphical user interface (GUI) to aid in manually labelling data using `tkinter`.
